        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img id ="bio-image" src="assets/images/IMG_4884b.jpg" alt="Brian Wong">
                 
        <p>My name is Brian Wong. I was born in Seattle and went to school at the University of Washington. My areas of concentration were Finance/Information System from the Michael G. Foster Business School and Economics from the School of Arts and Sciences.</p>

        <p>During my time at the University of Washington, I worked as a library assistant assigned to the Music Library. I was also a member of BITS (Business Information Technology Society) and the IMA Archery Club. I also took a course abroad in Shanghai, China to study and observe the rapid ascent of the modern Chinese economy.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include baseball, photography, commercial aviation, traveling. I am a fan of the Seattle Mariners and have been attending games since they were playing at the Kingdome.</p>

        <p>My past work experiences have spanned customer service, retail sales, IT outsourcing, and project management. My current career goals are to improve my technical skills and prepare myself for more data-intensive tasks. I have past experience with data visualization software such as Tableau and Power BI to create, develop, and maintain dashboards.</p>

        <p>I've lived abroad in Beijing, China for several years in order to practice my Chinese Mandarin and to have a personal viewpoint of the rapid development of the Chinese economy.</p>

        <p>Fun Fact: I've been to the tourist basecamp of Mount Everest in Tibet, the highest border crossing in the world at Khunjerab Pass (China-Pakistan border), and I've been atop the sand dunes of Khongoryn Els in Mongolia.</p>
